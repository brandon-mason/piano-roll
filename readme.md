## TODO
- Add start animation to give time for audio to load
- Change all css % values to discrete values
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Change width of note when recording over same note
- Record over recording, pause before all notes finish, then resume. Weird behavior
- Add undo recording
=======
- Notes don't play when brought back by 'undo'. Has something to do with how 'props.onNoteClicked' sends note info.
- Clicked notes disappear when recording starts.
